> __Update:__ I will be starting as an assistant professor at Imperial College London in January 2024, with a co-appointment from [Earth Science Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/) and [I-X (Imperial + AI)](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/). My group focuses on AI for Energy Transition, with special emphasis on subsurface energy storage and CO$_2$ geological storage. Please reach out if you are interested in [Ph.D. opportunity](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/grantham-institute/public/dtp/2024-projects/grantham-institute-2024-projects/2024_27_ESE_GW.pdf) in Fall 2024!

I am currently a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher working with Professor **[Martin J. Blunt](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.blunt)** and Dr. **[Branko Bijeljic](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.bijeljic)**  in the Earth Science and Engineering Department at Imperial College London. My research interest lies in computational methods for earth sciences.

With over five years of research experience, I specialize in multi-phase flow modeling and simulation in porous media across pore and continuum scales. My expertise is pivotal in advancing CO<sub>2</sub> and hydrogen storage solutions, enhancing digital twin models of manufactured porous structures, and refining flow processes in various applications. This understanding of pore-scale physics is essential in governing the large-scale phenomena that occur in porous media. It aids in interpreting underground reservoir behaviors, informs process design, and contributes significantly to the development of next-generation batteries. Furthermore, my research is instrumental in harnessing geothermal energy, managing groundwater resources responsibly, and conserving natural construction materials. The interplay between pore-scale physics and large-scale phenomena is fundamental, dictating processes ranging from energy extraction to material conservation strategies. 

Apart from my research, I am in charge of the **[pore-scale modelling webpage](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/research/research-groups/pore-scale-modelling/)** and also the **[porescale GitHub repository](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/porescale)**, which include all repositories developed in our group.
