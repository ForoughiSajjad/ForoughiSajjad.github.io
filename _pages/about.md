My research interest is in computational methods for earth sciences, with a special emphasis on multiphase flow and transport in porous media for CO$_2$ and hydrogen storage. With more than 5 years of dedicated research experience, my expertise lies in modeling and simulating multiphase flow in porous media at both pore and continuum scales. My primary focus involves understanding the challenges associated with multiphase flow in porous mediaâ€”a critical aspect in CO$_2$ and hydrogen storage, comprehending underground reservoirs, utilizing geothermal energy, responsibly managing groundwater resources, preserving natural construction materials, as well as contributing to process design and next-generation battery development. I emphasize the significance of studying pore-scale phenomena in driving advancements for large-scale energy transition projects.
